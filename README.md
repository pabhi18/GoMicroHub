MicroCraftGO: A Scalable Microservice in Golang

üöÄ Overview:

This project leverages a microservice architecture, developed in Go (Golang), to deliver a high-performance, scalable, and maintainable application. It integrates gRPC for service-to-service communication and RabbitMQ for message brokering, ensuring efficient and reliable communication across services.

With Docker Compose managing the services, this application is designed for easy orchestration and local development. A Makefile has been added to simplify workflows and enhance task management.

üß© Key Services:

**Logger Service**

   A centralized logging system, ensuring smooth tracking of application events.

   Database: MongoDB

**Authentication Service**

   Handles user authentication and security protocols.

   Database: PostgreSQL

**Mailer Service**:

   Manages email functionality for the application, ensuring communication via email.

   Testing: MailHog (local SMTP server for email testing)

**MailHog Service**

   A local SMTP server used to test and capture outgoing emails during development.

**Listener Service**

   A dedicated service for listening to RabbitMQ messages, enabling smooth communication between services.

**Broker Service**

   The primary entry point of the application, orchestrating requests and managing service coordination.
